# Web-Scraping

Science Rules Web-scraping:
This is an app created for unit 16 bootcamp homework. The idea behind it is using Cheerio and Mongoose to scrape news from a website (Inside Science). Users can then save news stories of interest, and leave comments/notes on them that will be available for all other users to see.

Motivation:
The app was created so that I could practice skills learned in class and gain further experience using Cheerio, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

Using the App:
The app is currently a work in progress as I am running into some issues with my scraping routes. Upon completion, it should scrape articles from the website that will then be displayed to users. This will include the headline and URL. Users can then save an article by clicking the saved button. All saved articles will be stored and can be viewed by clicking the view saved articles button. This end point allows users to unsave articles as well as leave or delete comments on articles that they saved. I am hoping to get this up and running after an office hours appointment to look at debugging.
